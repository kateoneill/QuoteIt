# QuoteIt
My mobile app for MAD1. QuoteIt is a Quote Storer and Manager.

#Introduction
Over the course of the past few weeks I created QuoteIt, a quote storing app where users can add quotes for safe-keeping. I attempted in the process of createion
to utilise GitHub and employing a Issue - branch - pull request - merge - close issue - delete branch workflow. This was very sporadically used throughout
development
<br><br>
This app was created using notes from Mobile App Development 1 labs as well as a couple of self-researched and added items. This app is built for android using 
Kotlin. This is my first attempt at coding an Android app and it was a very confusing process. Not everything works exactly as expected as I am still very unfamiliar
with the file structure among other things but it does have some cool features!

#Requirements
It is built as an android app using Kotlin

#Features
- Add a quote including a quotation, page number, book title, theme and ability to mark the quote as a favourite
- Quotes List in a RecyclerView on the home page
- Ability to update a quote
- Ability to delete a quote
- Ability to search for quote and have list display in the logCat
